Plato, a student of Socrates, founded the Academy in Athens and is renowned for his contributions to metaphysics, epistemology, and political philosophy. Born around 428 BCE and living until approximately 348 BCE, Plato's dialogues, including "The Republic," explored the nature of reality, the theory of forms, and the ideal state. Socrates was his most influential teacher.
