Socrates, often considered the father of Western philosophy, was an ancient Greek philosopher who focused on ethics and the pursuit of knowledge through dialogue. He believed in the importance of questioning and self-examination, famously saying, "The unexamined life is not worth living." Born around 470 BCE in Athens, Socrates did not leave behind any written records of his teachings. His most influential teacher was thought to be Archelaus.
