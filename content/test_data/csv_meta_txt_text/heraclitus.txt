Heraclitus, born around 535 BCE in Ephesus, focused on metaphysics and the nature of change. He is famous for the concept that "you cannot step into the same river twice," emphasizing the constant flux of the universe. Heraclitus believed in the unity of opposites and the transformative nature of fire. While his work is fragmentary, it has influenced later philosophers. His most influential teacher is not definitively known.
